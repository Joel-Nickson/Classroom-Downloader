# Classroom-Downloader
Downloads all submissions to an assignment from classroom.

#Current State:
* Downloads only image files and names them using the student name 
* Has no special way to handle multiple submissions or non-image files.

#To be done:
* Add options for files other than images 
* If there are multiple submissions, create a file named after the student and place them there, retaining the original file names
* Add way to download files such as Google Docs or Slides, probably using the .export() function
