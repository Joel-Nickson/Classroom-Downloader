Python Classroom File Downloader 

Setup:
Step 1: Go to console.developers.google.com and make sure you are logged in with an account that has Google Apps for Education enabled. Basically, if it's your school issued account or the one you log into Google Classroom with, you're good.
Step 2: Select the button that says "Enable API". It's blue.
Step 3: A list of APIs will pop up. Choose the one called "Google Drive API". You might have to search for it. 
Step 4: Click it and make sure that it's enabled. If it is, the big blue button near the top will say "DISABLE"
Step 5: Do steps 3 and 4 for the Google Classroom API. It's called "Google Classroom API"
Step 6: Navigate to the credentials tab. On the sidebar on the right, click "Credentials". There's a key next to it. 
Step 7: Click "Create Credentials". This will open a little drop down tab. Select "OAuth Client ID"
Step 8: You should now be in a screen labeled "Create Client ID" and there should be a series of radio buttons labeled "Application Type". Select "Other" and enter a name.
Step 9: Hit "Create"
Step 10: A dialog will pop up titled "OAuth Client" with boxes for client ID and client secret. Dismiss it by clicking "OK"
Step 11: You should be back to the Credentials tab now but there should be something underneath a title that says "OAuth 2.0 client IDs"
Step 12: Find the line that has the name you entered in Step 8. It's probably the only one there. Go the end of the line and click the download button. This will download a file called "client_secret_xxxxxx.json" or something similar. Rename it to "client_secret.json"
Step 13: Move the file downloaded in the previous step to the file where this Read Me is located.
